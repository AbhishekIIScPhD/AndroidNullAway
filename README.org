* Deploying Nullaway for an Android Application

** This repo has a sample application consisting of the build 
   changes to enable Nullaway annotation processor during build.

** I have made change to build.gradle of the application as suggested in the README of Nullaway.

** I have introduced an unwanted behaviour by passing null to @Nonnull annotated variable and hence 
   dereferencing the variable.

** Both the build click from within the Android Studio or doing ./gradlew build does not report a warning 
   for the unwanted behavior

* Things I have already tried.

** Built the artifact for the paper Nullaway and was able to see the warnings reported during the build.

** I tried introducing my own application with possible null dereferences in the application but was not 
   able to see any warnings.
