* Deploying Nullaway for an Android Application

  + This repo has a sample application consisting of the build 
    changes to enable Nullaway annotation processor during build.

  + I have made change to build.gradle of the application as suggested
    in the README of Nullaway.

  + I have introduced an unwanted behaviour by passing null to
    @Nonnull annotated variable and hence dereferencing the variable.

  + Both the build click from within the Android Studio or doing
    ./gradlew build does not report a warning for the unwanted
    behavior.

* I have also

  + Built the artifact for the paper Nullaway and was able to see the
    warnings reported during the build.
